# Classify

Go Rest API and Angular 4 Website to classify all kind of numerical datas

```mermaid
graph TD
A{Import} -->|Import2Item| B{Collection Item}
A --> |Tweaks| B
B -->|Item2Export| C{Export}
B --> |Tweaks|C
```

## What is the purpose ?

* Collect all my datas in one document, store them in a specified directory and print them
* When I scan a document, store the data in the specified document
* Classify all my movies/musics searching through APIs

## How is it organised ?

* Collections: where are stored all validated datas
* Imports: where are from the datas (files, emails, scanner, websites ...)
* Exports: where are written/moved the datas (file, database, printer ...)
* Websites: search for more informations about the data to classify
